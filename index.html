                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello Friend, I am a 25  year old unsigned producer. I currently work full-time as a software engineer for some huge company, and produce in my free time with the aspiration to create stage worth music for the mainstage and beyond.

Growing up I always loved computers and had wanted to build them. Somewhere down the road around 14 or 15 I was gifted Fruity Loops and begun casually writing music for fun. I knew that this was a rather pointless career choice so I kept it as a hobby for long time, continued with engineering,  and pushed forward with a degree in Computer engineering and Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts, aka. UMASS.    

While there I took graduate level computer science, machine learning, signal processing, ect.. courses that seemed somewhat related to making music. This was a very hard time in my life as I was by no means the bright, but I managed to keep my act together and pass. One constant throughout all the mayhem of engineering was my friends; in particular Dillon Stokes. At the time he was producing music for a record label and it inspired me to keep up with the music profession, start DJ'ing, work with Ableton, and how to better myself with my production techniques. 

Every so often I would go over to his music studio and we would have “studio sessions” where we would try to work together. They almost always ended in failure to complete a production, but I did learn something new. This included the ability to DJ, put a production together in a readable way, and much more. 

At one point I was in an Artificial Intelligence course, and was doing homework; or … trying to do homework when I saw a music video of a 3D hologram of 2-Pac on YouTube. It dawned on me that it wouldn't be hard to automate a piece of software to play music on a stage like they did. Taking this a step further I thought about creating AI to write music and I thought about what I would even call it, “... recurrsion?” Well maybe lets put a 3 in there for better Google searches, and thus the name R3currsion was born and assumed as my new identity.    

After graduating college I got a nice job working for a huge company. I then became very passionate about music, and vowed to try to make something out of a potential skill I had practiced over the ages. Since then I have ammased a huge library of samples, music production tools, studio equipment and most importantly skills.

Moving forward I plan on taking this career to the next level and trying to make something out of it. 

I hope you enjoyed the story, feel free to reach out and say hi :)</p>
